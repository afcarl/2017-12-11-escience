# Software development and data analysis

## Instructor: Ariel Rokem, The University of Washington eScience Institute
### Contact: arokem@gmail.com

The goals of this short course are to familiarize participants with
tools and practices used in data science to analyze tabular datasets
(such as administrative datasets). The course will focus on technical
aspects of the work, but we will also discuss communicating about data (data
visualization) and statistical methodology (machine learning).

## Preparation

Learning from this course a strong component of hands-on experience, so we
would like every one of the learners to be able to try things out on their
own computer. Please bring a laptop with you. We will use a browser to log
into a [Jupyterhub](http://jupyter.org/) website that we will set up for the
